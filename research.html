								<p>All living organisms on Earth interact with others. Whether these interactions are antagonistic, competitive, mutualistic, neutral, commensal, amensal, symbiotic, asymbiotic, obligate or facultative, or somewhere along these spectra, <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/species-interactions-and-competition-102131429" target="_blank">we all live surrounded by biological entities.</a> Advances and agreements in the scientific community suggest that living organisms' ecology and evolution cannot be fully understood without the consideration of all essential factors that influence their <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/life-history-evolution-68245673" target="_blank">life history traits.</a> The ecological niche of species is <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/explaining-general-patterns-in-species-abundance-and-23162842" target="_blank"> multidimensional, variable and include both biotic and abiotic elements.</a> Among all species interactions, the ones that have been essentially ignored in the past centuries are mutualisms, reciprocal beneficiary interactions between species. <a href="http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0006.xml" target="_blank">Mutualisms however are extremely common and provide essential ecosystem services.</a> My primary scientific interest is to study how mutualisms proceed in a multidimensional context that includes variation in their abiotic environment, as well as the influential species they interact with.</p>

							<h2 class="title">A desert fig-fig wasp mutualism</h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<img src="images/petiolaris and pegoscapus electron microscopy.png" width="26%" height="" alt="" class="alignright" />
								<p>In the <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/" target="_blank">Nason lab</a>, we are interested in <a href="http://www.figweb.org/Interaction/index.htm" target="_blank">fig-fig wasp mutualisms</a>. I am currently studying how variation in biotic and abiotic factors affect <a href="https://www.naturalista.mx/taxa/205972-Ficus-petiolaris" target="_blank"><em>Ficus petiolaris</em></a>, a desert rock strangling fig tree and its associated insects in Baja California, Mexico: one pollinating species (<em>Pegoscapus sp.</em>) and several antagonists. More specifically, by using observational approaches and multivariate statistical methods, I aim to test hypotheses that suggest potential relationships between the insects (dependent variables) and ecological factor related to the host tree biology (reproductive phenology, fig characteristics, tree density, …) as well as temperature and rainfall (independent variables). To answer these hypotheses, the Nason team sampled and measured the appropriate variables across several populations of the peninsula during four seasonal field trips. Day- and site-specific climate data where obtained thanks to global estimates generated by <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> and <a href="http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/" target="_blank">CHIRPS</a> from satellite imagery. My primary results suggest strong variation among sites and seasons, and a strong influence of both biotic and abiotic environmental factors on the fig-fig wasp-antagonists system, particularly climate variables.

								<img src="images/geolbreak.png" width="32%" height="" alt="" class="alignleft" />
								<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the universal component of living organisms and the physical basis of a very large amount of genetic information. Thanks to colossal advances in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2626" target="_blank">sequencing technology,</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/26687/10.1038_nrg1904.pdf" target="_blank">population genetics</a> and phylogenetics, it is now possible to infer the shallow and deep demographic histories of species. Mexico is one of the most <a href="https://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/v_ingles/country/whatismegcountry.html" target="_blank">biodiverse countries in the world</a>. It has high  ecosystem diversity and a rich geological history, particularly the Baja California peninsula which experienced several major geological events, that potentially affected the demography of Mexican species. <em>F. petiolaris</em>’s is the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/species/7262350" target="_blank">northernmost</a> endemic fig species in the New World, yet its history is unknown. I am interested in investigating how past geological and major climatic events have shaped the current genetic diversity of <em>F. petiolaris</em> and inffering its past history. This research will lay the groundwork for a larger comparative phylogeography project between the host fig tree and the many associated organisms (wasps, other antagonistic insects, nematodes) conducted with <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/people/kevin-quinteros" target="_blank">Kevin Quinteros</a> and <a href=" https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/people/john-nason " target="_blank">John Nason</a>. </p>

							<h2 class="title"><a>Projecting the future</a></h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<img src="images/bajatemp_tmp.jpg" width="35%" height="" alt="" class="alignright" />
						    <p>The rapid human driven environmental changes currently occurring are predicted to drastically affect Baja California in the near future. Several studies have presented future climate models in the region that predict an increase of temperature and a reduction of precipitation particularly affecting the northern part of the peninsula. Both of these climate factors are known to have major influences on living organisms, in particular insects. In the fig-fig wasp case, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/een.12528" target="_blank">recent experiments </a> have shown that fig wasps’ lifespans are greatly reduced above 35°C and limited to a couple of hours around 40°C. Thus, it is legitimate to wonder how the climate change in Baja California will impact the fig-fig wasp mutualism and when. From this information and the results obtained by estimating past and present effects of the climate on the fig-fig wasp-antagonists system and using correlative modeling, I hope to have a global view on the system and project the changes in the species distributions, community compositions and interactions based on future climate models. The results would greatly improve our estimation of species interaction outcomes in a changing environment and highlight potential conservation priorities.

							<h2 class="title">Mutualisms and their ecosystem services in a changing world</h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<p>Mutualism and facilitation are ubiquitous in our world, however their beneficial effect on natural and artificial ecosystems is generally unknown by the public. <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/mighty-mutualisms-the-nature-of-plant-pollinator-13235427" target="_blank">Pollination</a>, soil microbial mutualisms, mammalian gut flora, endosymbionts, nursery mutualisms, and seed dispersal are just a few examples of the many mutualistic interactions that occur in nature. The diversity along with the ecological and evolutionary roles of these beneficial interactions are very important. Sadly, the world is changing rapidly <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions" target="_blank">dramatically altering biodiversity</a> at a rate that could result in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/E6089" target="_blank">the 6<sup>th</sup> great extinction </a> which is rightly leading to growing concerns. Besides the loss of many species, the changing environment also alter the interactions between them. In the future I would like to combine science and education in order to highlight to the public the many forgotten organisms and interactions that surround us, their benefits, and the impact the human footprint has on this biodiversity.</p>
