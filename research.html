							<div class="entry">
								<img src="images/interaction.png" width="40%" height="" alt="" class="alignleft" />
								<p>All living organisms on Earth interact with others. Whereas these interactions are antagonistic, competitive, mutualistic or neutral, we all live surrounded by biological entities. Recent advances in the scientific community suggests that living organisms' biology cannot be fully understood without the inclusion of all the essential factors that influence their life history traits: the ecological niche of species is multidimensional and include both biotic and abiotic elements. Among all species interactions, the ones that has been essentially ignored in the last centuries are mutualisms, reciprocal beneficiary interactions among species. Mutualisms however are extremely common and provide essential ecosystem services. My primary scientific interest is to study how mutualisms proceed in a multidimensional context that includes variation in their abiotic environment, as well as the more important species they interact with.</p>

								<p>In the Nason lab, I am studying how variation in biotic and abiotic factors affect <em>Ficus petiolaris</em>, a desert rock strangling fig tree and its associated insects in Baja California, Mexico: one pollinating species (<em>Pegoscapus sp.</em>) and several antagonists. More specifically, by using observational approaches and multivariate statistical methods, I aim to test hypotheses claiming potential relationships between the insects (dependent variables) and ecological factor related to the host tree biology (reproductive phenology, fig characteristics, tree density, …) as well as temperature and rainfall (independent variables). To answer these hypotheses, the <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/" target="_blank">Nason team</a>  sampled and measured the appropriate variables across several populations of the peninsula during four seasonal field trips. Day and site specific climate estimates where optained thanks to <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> and <a href="http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/" target="_blank">CHIRPS</a>. My primary results suggest strong variation among sites and seasons, and a strong influence of both biotic and abiotic environmental factors on the fig-fig wasp-antagonists system, in particular climate variables.

							<h2 class="title"><a> Infering the past</a></h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<img src="images/geolbreak.png" width="32%" height="" alt="" class="alignleft" />
								<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the universal component of living organisms and the essential support of a very large amounts of genetic information. Thanks to colossal advances in population genetics and phylogenetics, it is now possible to infer the shallow and deep past demographic history of species. Mexico has a very riche geological and climatic history, in particular its peninsula which had several major geological event in the past, that potentially affected Mexican species’ demography. <em>F. petiolaris</em>’s is the most northern endemic fig species in the New World, and its history is unknown. I am interested in investigating how past geological and major climatic events have shaped the current genetic diversity of <em>F. petiolaris</em> and infer it’s past history. This research will set the base of a larger comparative phylogeography project between the host fig tree and the many associated organisms (wasps, other antagonistic insects, nematodes) with <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/people/kevin-quinteros" target="_blank">Kevin Quinteros</a> and <a href=" https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/people/john-nason " target="_blank">John Nason</a>. </p>

							<h2 class="title"><a>Projecting the future</a></h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<img src="images/bajatemp_tmp.jpg" width="35%" height="" alt="" class="alignright" />
						    <p>The human driven rapid environmental changes currently occurring is predicted to affect drastically Baja California in the near future. Several studies have presented future climate models in the region that predict an increase of temperature and a reduction of precipitation particularly affecting the northern part of the peninsula. Both these climate factors are known to have major influences on living organisms, in particular insects. In the fig-fig wasp case, recent experiments have shown that pollinating and non-pollinating’s lifespan is greatly reduced above 35°C and limited to a couple of hours around 40°C. Thus, it is legitimate to ask the question: how will the climate change in Baja California impact fig-fig wasp mutualism and when? From the results obtained by estimating past and present effect of the climate on the fig-fig wasp-antagonists system and using correlative modeling, I hope to project the changes in the species distribution, composition and interaction based on future climate models. The results would greatly improve our estimation of species interaction outcomes in a changing environment and highlight potential conservation priorities.

							<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Mutualism and their ecosystem services in a changing world</a></h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<p>Mutualism and facilitation are ubiquitous in our world, however their beneficial effect on natural and artificial ecosystems are generally unknown by the public. Pollination, soil microbial mutualisms, mammal gut flora, endosymbionts, nursery mutualisms, seed dispersal and many more, the ecological and evolutionary role of these beneficial interactions is very important. Sadly, the world is changing rapidly, and a great extinction is currently happening. Besides the loss of many species, the changing environment also alter the interactions between them. My future professional goal is to combine science and education in order to highlight to the public the many forgotten organisms and interactions that surround us, their benefits, and the human footprint on this biodiversity.</p>
